- This is especially important on macOS, where you already got Python 2.7 pre-installed. 
To NOT use that, run **python3**  instead of python .

- install vscode

- Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:
```
>>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here
>>> 4 ** 3  # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65!
64
>>> cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value
>>> cubes
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
```
- 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7 //128
- String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. 
- word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
- Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. 
This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:
- the length of word[1:3] is 2
```
word = 'python'
>>> word[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)
'Py'
>>> word[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
'on'
>>> word[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end
'on'
```
- len(s)
```
All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. 
This means that the following slice returns a new (shallow) copy of the list:

>>> squares[:]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
